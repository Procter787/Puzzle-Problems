// There are 100 switches in a room operating 100 bulbs. Initially all switches are off. You are asked to make 100 passes through them, in such a manner that during i th pass all the switches that are multiples of i are toggled (if a switch is off, you switch it on, if it is on, you switch it off). For example, during 10th pass you will toggle switch number 10,20,30â€¦.100. After completing 100 passes through the switches how many bulbs are on?
 
// Answer: 10

var switches = 100;

var switchArr = new Array(switches);

for (var i = 0; i < switches; i++) {
  switchArr[i] = false;
}



function onOff (arr){

  var i = 0
  
  // set the first value to true because it will always be on after the first itteration
  arr[0] = true

//create a while loop to loop through 100 
  while(arr.length > i){

// increment by 1 through the loop
    i++;

// j = whatever value you are supposed to find multiples of and when the j = j + i is hit it will keep adding j to i untill the array is complete
     for(var j = i; j < arr.length; j = j + i){

//if j is on change it to off and the opposite if it is off
         if(arr[j] == true){
           arr[j] = false;
         } else {
           arr[j] = true;
         }
    } 
  }

// return the length of the arr and use the filter method to filter out the undesired values
    return arr.filter(Boolean).length
}



console.log(onOff(switchArr))
// console.log(arr)

// for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ){
   
  // }
